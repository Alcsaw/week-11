## The OmniStack

OmniStack is the name given by Rocketseat to a fullstack of Javascript composed by Node.js on the back end, ReactJS on the front end and React Native for the mobile. One single programming language to dominate the entire development cycle, using technologies seen in many of the big companies today.


During the OmniStack week, Rocketseat provides 5 online classes - 1 each day from Monday to Friday - teaching how to build an app from scratch and finishing with an MVP. Every edition of this event brings a new app idea and the 11th one is here with Be The Hero.

## Be The Hero

The application developed in this week is called Be The Hero, a platform that connects NGOs  that need some assistance with people who can help.


For example, a NGO that takes care of abbandoned animals, can create an incident about a dog found on the street that is hurt and need a vet, which would cost a certain amount of money. This case would become public and a user of the mobile app can help, being the Hero of that case, by donating the needed amount of money to that NGO.


The website allows the NGO to view...

and register new incidents:

While the app allows users to see cases that need help:
